## 📘 Microelectronics by Sedra and Smith

This repo is to track my journey through Sedra and Smiths Microelectronics textbook (8th Edition). This repo. will contain my **note, solved psets, LaTeX source files, and circuit simulations** as I work thorugh the book. More specifically: 
Chapters: **1.7 - 1.12, 3, 4, 5, and 6.**

## 🎯 Goals  

- Maintain **clean, well-typeset notes and solutions** using LaTeX.  
- Reinforce theory with **circuit simulations** (LTSpice/[maybe]Ngspice).  
- Build a reusable knowledge base for future reference.  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Workflow  

- **LaTeX** – for notes and problem sets  
- **LTSpice / Ngspice** – for simulations  
- **Git + GitHub** – version control and publishing  
- **Handwritten notes** (tablet) → **Typeset solutions** (LaTeX)  

---

## 🚀 How to Use This Repo  

- `\Chapter-X` for a respective chapter. Inside will be the compiled PDFs for both PSETs and Chapter notes
- `..\source\notes` and `..\source\problems` for the source LaTeX docs.
- `..\simulations\` for LTSpice simulations

```
Hey I am currently writing a readme for a github repo regarding my journey through Sedra and Smiths Microelectronics.
It will contain my notes, solved psets, simulations, and source LaTeX files. What is a good readme for such a repo?
